# Template Spring boot Restserver
We create a simple Usermangagement Spring boot Rest API.
You only have to run a MariaSQL Database
The theme is freeschool, you have to change this in following Files:

api/src/main/resources/application.properties

api/src/main/java/de/freeschool/api/controller/MetaController.java

and the package name has to be refactored

# Backend
Spring Boot Rest API is the backend of the FreeSchool Learning Platform. It is a Java-based framework that is used to create a microservices architecture. The backend is responsible for handling all the business logic and data processing. It interacts with the database to store and retrieve data. The backend also communicates with the frontend to send and receive data.

# Frontend
The Frontend could be made with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building native Android UI (also making Websites). It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. The frontend will interact with the backend to display data to the user and allow them to interact with the platform.
