# FreeSchool
FreeSchool Learning Platform is an innovative online educational resource designed specifically for Free Schools and their learning centers. Our platform offers a wide range of high-quality video tutorials that cater to diverse educational needs.

# Backend
Spring Boot Rest API is the backend of the FreeSchool Learning Platform. It is a Java-based framework that is used to create a microservices architecture. The backend is responsible for handling all the business logic and data processing. It interacts with the database to store and retrieve data. The backend also communicates with the frontend to send and receive data.

# Frontend
The Frontend will be made with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building native Android UI (also making Websites). It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. The frontend will interact with the backend to display data to the user and allow them to interact with the platform.
